/**
 * 1. Name of the variable
 *  Rules:
 *    - keep it camelcase (myVariableName)
 *    - Don't use any spaces or any other special character (except '_') (my_variable_name)
 *    - Don't use keywords as variable names (for, const, typeof)
 *    - Keep the (declare) variables as close as possible to where they are used
 * 2. Use 'const' or the 'let' keyword (Don't use var) (Rule of thumb always use const)
 * 3. Use the assignment operator '='
 * 4. Put the value on the right hand side of the assignment operator
 *    - This value can be anything
